### 3. Customize your theme colors and metadata
The theme in VS Code can be easily summarized as a long JSON file, filled with various variables and color tokens that might not make much sense at first glance. üé®
Each of these keys represents a specific part of the editor ‚Äî like syntax highlighting, UI elements, or brackets ‚Äî and tweaking them lets you control how your entire coding environment looks and feels.
While it may seem overwhelming in the beginning, once you start experimenting and understanding what each section does, it becomes a creative playground for customizing your perfect theme.üí°

### 4. Test your theme using VS Code
Previewing the changes you make to the JSON file will help with the experimentation. For this task we will be using *Theme Debugger*.
To preview and test your theme live:

1. Open the theme project in **VS Code**
2. Simply click on **Run > Start Debugging** or press `F5`
3. A new VS Code window will open with your theme applied for testing

### 5. Publish it on the Marketplace!
There are a number of steps involved before you publish it
1. Sign Up with Microsift Azure DevOps
2. Create an Organization
3. Register your theme
4. Publish it

### 6. 

**Voila!! You have successfully made a theme for yourself and others to use**
